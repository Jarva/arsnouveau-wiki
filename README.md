# Automatically generated Wiki for Ars Nouveau

The aim of this project is to automatically gather all Patchouli Documentation from the Ars Nouveau Repository
and display it in a human-readable format.

Expansions in the far future could be making it configurable via environment variables,
so that arbitrary mods and repositories could be displayed
